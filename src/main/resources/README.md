This directory stores the compiled versions of the Argon2 C library.

The subfolders must have the name of the platform, for which the library has been compiled. See [the JNA documentation](https://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.2.1/com/sun/jna/NativeLibrary.html) for details. You can use [this tool](https://github.com/phxql/jna-info) to retrieve the platform name.

The libraries are compiled from [this source code](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/releases/tag/20160406).
