This directory stores the compiled versions of the Argon2 C library.

The subfolders must have the name of the platform, for which the library has been compiled. See [the JNA documentation](https://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.2.1/com/sun/jna/NativeLibrary.html#getInstance-java.lang.String-) for details.

The libraries are compiled from [this source code](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2)
